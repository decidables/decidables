Helper functions for calculations related to the Diffusion Decision Model for
[<b><i>a</i>ccumulable</b>](https://decidables.github.io/accumulable).

## Usage

### Install

```shell
yarn add @decidables/accumulable-math
```

### Use

```javascript
import DDMMath from '@decidables/accumulable-math';
```

A class providing static functions for calculating Diffusion Decision Model equations

## Contents

### `DDMMath`

Single class exposing static functions for DDM calculations. Each function takes values for one or
more variables and returns the value of another variable. The functions are named with a list of the
input variables followed by a '2' followed by the output variable, in camelcase. For example,
`azvs2pC` takes as input the boundary separation, `a`, the starting point, `z`, the drift rate, 'v',
and the non-decision time, `t0`, and outputs the probability correct, `pC`.

#### Variable names

- a = boundary separation
- z = starting point
- v = drift rate
- t0 = non0decision time

#### Methods w/implemented equations

- `azvs2pE(a, zprime, v, s)`
- `azvs2pC(a, zprime, v, s)`
- `tazvs2gE(t, a, zprime, v, s)`
- `tazvs2gC(t, a, zprime, v, s)`
