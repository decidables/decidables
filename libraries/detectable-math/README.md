# detectable-math: Equations for Calculating Signal Detection Theory

## Contents

- `SDTMath`: Single class exposing static functions for SDT calculations

---

## Features/Bugs/Notes

- Unequal variance
  - Ambiguity about with what to hold constant when varying other parameters in the
    context of unequal variance
  - d' vs d_a, and c vs c_a
  - muN != muS != d'
  - lambda != c
  - distinction between parameter s and sigma

## Development Tooling

### Local Scripts

- `yarn lint`
  - Lints markdown, scripts and styles
- `yarn test`
  - Runs all tests and reports coverage in `test/coverage/`
- `yarn test:watch`
  - Runs all tests in watch mode and reports coverage in `test/coverage/`
- `yarn test:file <filename>`
  - Runs tests for a single file and reports coverage in `test/coverage/`
- `yarn build`
  - Builds bundles from `src/` to `lib/`
