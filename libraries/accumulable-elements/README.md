Note: **NOT PUBLISHED YET!**

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@decidables/accumulable-elements?logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decidables/accumulable-elements)
[![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@decidables/accumulable-elements?color=informational)](https://github.com/decidables/decidables/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

The web components used to visualize the Diffusion Decision Model in
[<b><i>a</i>ccumulable</b>](https://decidables.github.io/accumulable). There is an emphasis
on direct manipulation and consistent use of color. SVG is used extensively to provide clean
scalable diagrams.

## Usage

### Install

```shell
yarn add @decidables/accumulable-elements
```

### Use

```javascript
import '@decidables/accumulable-elements';
```

A bare import is used to register the elements in the custom registry, so they are then available
for use in HTML.

## Contents

### Components

Building blocks for interactive visualizations of DDM

#### `AccumulableParameters` / `<accumulable-parameters>`

Control panel for DDM parameter values

#### `DDMSamplePaths` / `<ddm-sample-paths>`

Visualization of the DDM model

Displays a drift diffusion process with boundaries, a potentially biased starting point,
non-decision time, and a drift rate - all of which can be directly manipulated.

### Equations

Interactive equations for DDM

The equations can either be static and display the variable names, be static and display names and
values or be interactive with names and editable values, in which case only the values on the right
side of the equals sign are editable.

**Note:** The layout for these equations leaves something to be desired, especially on smaller
screens. Ideally a proper math renderer would be used, but I haven't found one that takes kindly to
insertion of the custom elements needed for live editing.

#### `DDMEquation`

Base class for all interactive DDM equations

To define a new equation:

```javascript
export default class DDMEquationSomething extends DDMEquation {
  ...
}
```

`DDMEquation` extends `AccumulableElement` extends `DecidablesElement` extends `LitElement`

### Examples

Full examples built from multiple components

#### `DDMExampleInteractive` / `<ddm-example-interactive>`

Explore how RT and accuracy relate to DDM model parameters

Used to build examples where the user can explore the relationship between RT and accuracy and model
parameters. All components can be interactive.

#### `DDMExample`

Base class for all DDM examples

To define a new example:

```javascript
export default class DDMExampleSomething extends DDMExample {
  ...
}
```

`DDMExample` extends `AccumulableElement` extends `DecidablesElement` extends `LitElement`

### Base class

#### `AccumulableElement`

Base class for all *accumulable* web components

To define a new element:

```javascript
export default class AccumulableElementSomething extends AccumulableElement {
  ...
}
```

`AccumulableElement` extends `DecidablesElement` extends `LitElement`

## Development

### Features/Bugs/Notes
