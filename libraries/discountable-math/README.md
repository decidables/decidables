Helper functions for calculations related to Hyperbolic Temporal Discounting for
[<b>dis<i>k</i>ountable</b>](https://decidables.github.io/discountable).

## Usage

### Install

```shell
yarn add @decidables/discountable-math
```

### Use

```javascript
import CPTMath from '@decidables/discountable-math';
```

A class providing static functions for calculating Hyperbolic Temporal Discounting equations

## Contents

### `HTDMath`

Single class exposing static functions for HTD calculations. Each function takes values for one or
more variables and returns the value of another variable. The functions are named with a list of the
input variables followed by a '2' followed by the output variable, in camelcase. For example,
`adk2v` takes as input the amount, `a`, the delay, `d`, and a discounting factor, `k`, and outputs
the value, `v`.

#### Variable names

- a = objective amount
- d = delay
- v = subjective value
- k = discounting factor

#### Methods w/implemented equations

- `adk2v(a, d, k)`
  - v = a / (1 + k * d)
- `adv2k(a, d, v)`
  - k = (a - v) / (v * d)
