	abstract = {Computational modeling has become a central aspect of research in the cognitive neurosciences. As the field matures, it is increasingly important to move beyond standard models to quantitatively assess models with richer dynamics that may better reflect underlying cognitive and neural processes. For example, sequential sampling models ({SSMs}) are a general class of models of decision-making intended to capture processes jointly giving rise to {RT} distributions and choice data in n-alternative choice paradigms. A number of model variations are of theoretical interest, but empirical data analysis has historically been tied to a small subset for which likelihood functions are analytically tractable. Advances in methods designed for likelihood-free inference have recently made it computationally feasible to consider a much larger spectrum of {SSMs}. In addition, recent work has motivated the combination of {SSMs} with reinforcement learning models, which had historically been considered in separate literatures. Here, we provide a significant addition to the widely used {HDDM} Python toolbox and include a tutorial for how users can easily fit and assess a (user-extensible) wide variety of {SSMs} and how they can be combined with reinforcement learning models. The extension comes batteries included, including model visualization tools, posterior predictive checks, and ability to link trial-wise neural signals with model parameters via hierarchical Bayesian regression.},

Recently, choice response time models have become more accessible through the release of user-friendly software for estimating their parameters. The aim of this tutorial is to provide guidance about the process of using these parameter estimates and associated model fits to make conclusions about experimental data. We use an application of one response time model, the linear ballistic accumulator, as an example to demonstrate the steps required to select an appropriate parametric characterization of a data set.

In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data-accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions-into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the {LBA} model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts.

Sequential-sampling models like the diffusion model have a long history in psychology. They view decision making as a process of noisy accumulation of evidence from a stimulus.

This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality. Diffusion models have been used successfully in a range of cognitive tasks and as psychometric tools in clinical research to examine individual differences.

	abstract = {The diffusion model is a commonly used tool to infer latent psychological processes underlying decision-making, and to link them to neural mechanisms based on response times. Although efficient open source software has been made available to quantitatively fit the model to data, current estimation methods require an abundance of response time measurements to recover meaningful parameters, and only provide point estimates of each parameter. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation methods are useful for enhancing statistical power, allowing for simultaneous estimation of individual subject parameters and the group distribution that they are drawn from, while also providing measures of uncertainty in these parameters in the posterior distribution. Here, we present a novel Python-based toolbox called {HDDM} (hierarchical drift diffusion model), which allows fast and flexible estimation of the the drift-diffusion model and the related linear ballistic accumulator model. {HDDM} requires fewer data per subject/condition than non-hierarchical methods, allows for full Bayesian data analysis, and can handle outliers in the data. Finally, {HDDM} supports the estimation of how trial-by-trial measurements (e.g., {fMRI}) influence decision-making parameters. This paper will first describe the theoretical background of the drift diffusion model and Bayesian inference. We then illustrate usage of the toolbox on a real-world data set from our lab. Finally, parameter recovery studies show that {HDDM} beats alternative fitting methods like the χ2-quantile method as well as maximum likelihood estimation.

The model has a pair of criteria that represent the amounts of evidence needed to make each response. The time taken to reach criterion determines the decision time and the criterion that is reached first determines the response. The model predicts choice probabilities and the distributions of response times for correct responses and errors as a function of experimental conditions such as stimulus discriminability, speed-accuracy instructions, and manipulations of relative stimulus frequency, which affect response bias. This chapter describes the main features of the model, including mathematical methods for obtaining response time predictions, methods for fitting it to experimental data, including alternative fitting criteria, and ways to represent the fit to multiple experimental conditions graphically in a compact way. The chapter concludes with a discussion of recent work in psychology that links evidence accumulation to processes of perception, attention, and memory, and in neuroscience, to neural firing rates in the oculomotor control system in monkeys performing saccade-to-target decision tasks.},

The four methods for simulating response probabilities and response times are compared on two criteria: simulation speed and accuracy of the simulation. It is concluded that the rejection-based and probability integral transform method perform best on both criteria, and that the stochastic differential approximation is worst. An important drawback of the rejection method is that it is applicable only to the Wiener process, whereas the probability integral transform method is more general.},

In recent years, the advantages of the Ratcliff diffusion model have become increasingly clear. Current advances in methodology allow all researchers to fit the diffusion model to data easily.

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

	abstract = {Response time ({RT}) data play an important role in psychology. The diffusion model ({DM}) allows to analyze {RT}-data in a two-alternative-force-choice paradigm using a particle drift diffusion modeling approach. It accounts for right-skewed distributions in a natural way. However, the model incorporates seven parameters, the roles of which are difficult to comprehend from the model equation. Therefore, the present article introduces the diffusion model visualizer ({DMV}) allowing for interactive manipulation of each parameter and plotting the resulting {RT} densities. Thus, the {DMV} serves as a valuable tool for understanding the specific role of each model parameter. It may come in handy for didactical purposes and in research context. It allows for tracking down parameter estimation problems by delivering the model-based ideal densities, which can be juxtaposed to the data-based densities. It will also serve a valuable purpose in detecting outliers. The article describes the basics of the {DM} along with technical details of the {DMV} and gives several hints for its usage.},
