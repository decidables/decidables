In both, a weight of evidence is computed and accumulated to support or oppose the alternative interpretations. A decision is reached when the evidence reaches a threshold value. In the codebreaking scheme, the threshold determined the speed and accuracy of the decision process. Here we propose that in the brain, the threshold may be controlled by neural circuits that calculate the rate of reward.},

Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

In the memory field, the view that there are independent implicit and explicit memory systems has been predominantly supported by dissociation evidence. Here, we argue that many of these dissociations do not necessarily imply distinct memory systems. We review recent work with a single-system computational model that extends signal-detection theory (SDT) to implicit memory. SDT has had a major influence on research in a variety of domains. The current work shows that it can be broadened even further in its range of application. Indeed, the single-system model that we present does surprisingly well in accounting for some key dissociations that have been taken as evidence for independent implicit and explicit memory systems.},

	abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},

	abstract = {Random dot motion (RDM) displays have emerged as one of the standard stimulus types employed in psychophysical and physiological studies of motion processing. RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difficult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We find that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion direction processing.},

	abstract = {Motion coherence thresholds in random-dot patterns have been widely adopted as a measure of performance in visual motion processing. However, there has been diversity in the type of “noise” in which a coherent motion signal has to be detected. Here we compare coherence thresholds for three ways of creating motion noise: dots replotted in random positions in each new frame; dots with a set displacement but following a random walk from frame to frame; or dots moving in random directions which remain constant for a given dot over a sequence of displacements. In each case, the signal dots may either remain the same throughout the display sequence, or the signal dots may be re-selected afresh on each frame (“different”). With our display (3 deg square, 120 msec exposure, velocity = 5 or 10 deg sec−1), all these different noise conditions yielded similar thresholds around 5–8\%. There were some small but systematic differences between conditions. Thresholds in random-direction displays were consistently higher than those in random-walk or random-position displays, especially at the lower velocity. However, this effect is much smaller than would be expected from the increased standard error of the noise mean in random direction, perhaps because the motion system integrates information most effectively over a local region of space and/or time. Subjects” performance could not be explained by a strategy of identifying individual signal dots with extended trajectories. The similarity between random-walk and random-position thresholds implies that subjects do not exploit the marked differences in speed distribution between signal and noise dots in the latter case. The practical message for the design and interpretation of experiments using coherence thresholds is that the results are not much affected by the choice of noise, at least within the range of stimuli tested here.

	abstract = {Can we study individual differences in sensitivity and response bias, using indices like the d' and β of signal detectability theory? To do this, it would be desirable to be able to estimate them independently and consistently. Sensitivity, measured by d', is not influenced by variations in β provided the variance of the noise distribution is equal to that of the signal-plus-noise distribution, but no such deduction can be made for β. The intra-individual variances can be assumed to be approximately equal in the investigation described, and d' may therefore be estimated without contamination by β. It cannot be assumed, however, that β remains stable for different levels of d'; in fact it can be shown to depend upon the decision strategy adopted by the subject. The consistency and orthogonality of indices of sensitivity and bias have been examined in an auditory detection task. Reasonably consistent estimates of d' were obtained from as few as forty responses. The bias index β was less satisfactory but another index related to it was more promising. The latter was orthogonal to d', under certain conditions, in the two-dimensional space describing inter-individual variation in detection behaviour. © 1970.},

	abstract = {This book provides a grounded introduction to the fundamental concepts of mathematics, neuroscience and their combined use, thus providing the reader with a springboard to cutting-edge research topics and fostering a tighter integration of mathematics and neuroscience for future generations of students. The book alternates between mathematical chapters, introducing important concepts and numerical methods, and neurobiological chapters, applying these concepts and methods to specific topics. It covers topics ranging from classical cellular biophysics and proceeding up to systems level neuroscience. Starting at an introductory mathematical level, presuming no more than calculus through elementary differential equations, the level will build up as increasingly complex techniques are introduced and combined with earlier ones. Each chapter includes a comprehensive series of exercises with solutions, taken from the set developed by the authors in their course lectures. MATLAB code is included for each computational figure, to allow the reader to reproduce them.

Sequential-sampling models like the diffusion model have a long history in psychology. They view decision making as a process of noisy accumulation of evidence from a stimulus. The standard model assumes that evidence accumulates at a constant rate during the second or two it takes to make a decision. This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality. Diffusion models have been used successfully in a range of cognitive tasks and as psychometric tools in clinical research to examine individual differences. In this review, we relate the models to both earlier and more recent research in psychology.},

	abstract = {Feeling, or the subjective emotional experience, is a fundamental element of the emotional reaction, yet past attempts to understand the mechanisms of feeling generation remain limited. The current study presents a signal detection theory (SDT) conceptualization of feeling generation. Accordingly, feeling, like other sensations, reflects an outcome of an inner decision regarding the emotional evidence, and, therefore, can be evaluated via 2 processes: evidence differentiation (d′)—the ability to emotionally differentiate between external stimuli, given the essentially noisy evidence—and criterion (c)—the report threshold, or amount of evidence needed to have an intense reportable feeling. According to the model, feelings can be disproportionally intense (false alarms; e.g., emotional overreaction) or disproportionally weak (misses; e.g., failing to detect danger), with the criterion controlling the relative proportion of these 'errors.' Results from a novel task indicate that our conceptualization provides a suitable model for valence (pleasant–unpleasant) feeling generation, as reflected in superior model fit relative to plausible alternative models, nonsignificant lack of fit, and by successful experimental tests of a novel prediction regarding contextual influences and related uncertainty. Additional evidence for the external validity of the model shows that SDT parameters, especially the criterion, were meaningfully correlated with relevant emotion regulation and affective style constructs. Implications for the understanding of feeling generation, in general, and in psychopathology, in particular, are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The experiments provide ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves that give information about the standard deviations of familiarity values for old and new test items in the models. The experimental results are consistent with normal distributions of familiarity (a prediction of the models). However, the results also show that the new-item familiarity standard deviation is about 0.8 that of the old-item familiarity standard deviation and independent of the strength of the old items (under the assumption of normality). The models are inconsistent with these results because they predict either nearly equal old and new standard deviations or increasing values of old standard deviation with strength. Thus, the data provide the basis for revision of current models or development of new models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The dual-process hypothesis states that ROC slopes are less than 1.00 because they are produced by two independent memory factors: recollection and familiarity. Four experiments tested the constancy-of-slopes generalization. The results contradicted the generalization. Slopes changed when accuracy was changed by varying study time, word frequency, and encoding task. A survey of the literature showed slope changes produced by those variables and also by other variables. Analyses of the shapes of ROCs were used to test the dual-process hypothesis.

With simulated and empirical data, the new sensitivity index is shown to be more accurate than d′ and 16 other indices when these measures are used to compare the sensitivity levels of 2 experimental conditions. Results from a perceptual discrimination experiment demonstrate the feasibility of the new distribution-free bias index and suggest that biases of the type defined within the signal detection theory framework (i.e., the placement of a decision criterion) do not exist, even under an asymmetric payoff manipulation.

These measures require simplifying assumptions about how target and lure evidence is distributed. We examine three statistical properties of these indexes: accuracy (good agreement between the parameter and the sampling distribution mean), precision (small variance of the sampling distribution), and robustness (small influence of violated assumptions on accuracy). We draw several conclusions from the results. First, a variety of parameters (sample size, degree of discriminability, and magnitude of hits and false alarms) influence statistical bias in these indexes. Comparing conditions that differ in these parameters entails discrepancies that can be reduced by increasing N. Second, unequal variance of the evidence distributions produces significant bias that cannot be reduced by increasing N—a serious drawback to the use of these sensitivity indexes when variance is unknown. Finally, their relative statistical performances suggest thatAz is preferable toA’.},

Thus, trials with a signal presentation consist of a mixture of 2 (or more) latent classes of trials. Mixture SDT provides a general theoretical framework that offers a new perspective on a number of findings. For example, mixture SDT offers an alternative to the unequal variance signal detection model; it can also account for nonlinear normal receiver operating characteristic curves, as found in recent research.

Signal detection theory describes these types of decisions. In this tutorial, we show how incorporating the economic concept of utility allows signal detection theory to serve as a model of optimal decision making, going beyond its common use as an analytic method. This utility approach to signal detection theory clarifies otherwise enigmatic influences of perceptual uncertainty on measures of decision-making performance (accuracy and optimality) and on behavior (an inverse relationship between bias magnitude and sensitivity optimizes utility). A “utilized” signal detection theory offers the possibility of expanding the phenomena that can be understood within a decision-making framework.},

The most promising way to reject 3-LHT, and all other threshold theories as well, would be to show that the posterior probability of the signal, given the response, can approach zero for moderate signal strengths.

The issue of underlying theoretical discriminability only arises when theoreticians seek to explain why one eyewitness identification procedure yields a higher pAUC than another. Lampinen (2016) also argued that favoring the procedure that yields a higher pAUC can lead to an irrational decision outcome. However, his argument depends on needlessly restricting which points from two ROCs can be compared. As a general rule, the maximum-utility point will fall somewhere on the higher ROC, underscoring the need for ROC analysis.

	abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of neuronal activity related to sensorimotor transformation during single experimental trials of a given stimulus–response (S-R) association task. A monkey was trained to perform wrist extension/flexion movements in the horizontal plane to align a pointer with a visual target while single unit activity in the primary motor cortex (MI) was being recorded. The stimulus was a colored light-emitting diode (LED) presented to either the left or right of a central reference point. The monkey had to point directly at the target (“compatible” S-R mapping) or point to the opposite side of the target position (“incompatible” S-R mapping), with the mapping rule specified by the color of the LED. Single neuron activities on the four correct trials (left/right stimulus × compatible/incompatible S-R mapping) were compared to determine whether such activities were more related to stimulus encoding and representation, to response preparation and execution, or to the “decision” processes translating the stimulus representation into a response representation. A novel mathematical technique, called LOCUS ANALYSIS, has been developed to quantitatively analyze and visualize the contribution of neuronal activity toward the sensory, motor, or sensorimotor (i.e., decisional) aspects of the task. Our data show that as a trial evolves, neuronal activity in MI, at a population level, is first correlated with the representation of the specific stimulus (the side of LED), then with the representation of the S-R mapping rule (the color of LED) as well as trial-specific S-R association (the conjunction of stimulus side and stimulus color), and finally with the representation of the behavioral response (extension or flexion wrist movement). Immediately after the issuance of the movement command, the populational activity in MI remains correlated with the trial-specific stimulus-response conjunctions, i.e., the context of the motor decision that the monkey has just made. Cells recorded successively in a single penetration tend to resemble each other in their pattern of firing on the four correct trials, suggesting a modular organization of neurons based on their functional role in the processing of the S-R association task. Our results indicate that MI belongs to a distributed network such that its neuronal activity reflects the underlying network dynamics that translate a stimulus representation into a response representation via the activation and application of appropriate S-R mapping rule.},
