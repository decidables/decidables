## Making a decision

On the previous page, we explored the first step in signal detection according to SDT: taking a
measurement. Now it is time to consider the second step: making a :term[decision]. Our model will
use the evidence to decide whether it is going to respond :key['present'] or :key['absent'].

According to SDT, a :term[threshold] is set, such that on each trial, the evidence is either greater
than or less than that threshold. A simple rule is then used to decide on a response: if the
evidence is below the threshold respond :key['absent'], and if the evidence is
above the threshold respond :key['present'].

Here, it is the *model* that is responding to the stimulus on each trial based on the evidence and
the threshold, instead of you, our intrepid participant.

<sdt-example-model>
  <detectable-control run pause reset trials="10" duration="500"></detectable-control>
  <rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="10" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task>
  <sdt-model histogram threshold color="response" d="2.5" c="0"></sdt-model>
  <detectable-response feedback="none"></detectable-response>
</sdt-example-model>

The box representing the measurement for each trial indicates whether it was a :key['Present']
response or an :key['Absent'] response. The vertical bar represents the threshold.

## A higher or lower threshold

In the example above, the threshold was set at the neutral point, where the evidence is equally
suggestive of :key[signal] and :key[noise]. But SDT doesn't require this. When the threshold is
moved to one side or the other, we say the model is exhibiting :term[bias].

The threshold can be set *higher*, so that stronger evidence must be measured for the model to
respond :key['present']. In this case, the model will respond :key['present'] for a narrow range of
values, and we say that the model has a :term[conservative bias]:

<sdt-example-model>
  <detectable-control run pause reset trials="10" duration="500"></detectable-control>
  <rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="10" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task>
  <sdt-model histogram threshold color="response" d="2.5" c="2"></sdt-model>
  <detectable-response feedback="none"></detectable-response>
</sdt-example-model>

Or the threshold can be set *lower*, so that even with weak evidence the model will respond
:key['present']. In this case, the model will respond :key['present'] for a wider range of values,
and we say that the model has a :term[liberal bias]:

<sdt-example-model>
  <detectable-control run pause reset trials="10" duration="500"></detectable-control>
  <rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="10" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task>
  <sdt-model histogram threshold color="response" d="2.5" c="-2"></sdt-model>
  <detectable-response feedback="none"></detectable-response>
</sdt-example-model>

Note that the use of *conservative* and *liberal* here refer to their non-political meanings of
"strict or cautious" versus "lenient or tolerant". 

## Parameterizing our threshold with bias, <span class="math-var">c</span>

The location of our threshold determines the :term[response bias] of our model, defined as
:term[<span class="math-var">c</span>]. The :key[bias], :key[<span class="math-var">c</span>], lies
along a continuum from negative infinity to infinity. Zero indicates a neutral bias. Positive
numbers indicate a conservative bias. The larger the positive bias, the *more* evidence necessary
before a :key['present'] response is given. Negative numbers indicate a liberal bias. The larger the
negative bias, the *less* evidence necessary to respond :key['present'].

Explore how the :key[bias] determines how little or how much evidence is necessary to respond
:key['present'] versus :key['absent']:

<sdt-example-model>
  <detectable-control run pause reset trials="10" duration="500"></detectable-control>
  <rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="10" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task>
  <sdt-model interactive threshold bias histogram color="response" d="2.5" c="1"></sdt-model>
  <detectable-response feedback="none"></detectable-response>
</sdt-example-model>

:::ui

The distance from the origin, or neutral point, to the threshold is explicitly labeled with
:key[<span class="math-var">c</span>]. This is a *live* graph, so you can drag the threshold line or
its handle to adjust its position. If there are evidence measurements for individual trials, they
will change between :key['Present'] responses and :key['Absent'] responses based on the location of
the threshold, allowing you to see the effect of :key[Bias] on behavior.

:::

If you are wondering why :key[bias] is represented with the symbol :key[<span
class="math-var">c</span>], perhaps it is because the threshold is often referred to as a <span
class="math-var">c</span>riterion in the work on SDT. However, this reason was not explicitly stated
in the original paper introducing :key[<span class="math-var">c</span>] :cite[@Ingham1970].

Note that when :key[<span class="math-var">c</span>] is zero, the threshold is precisely where the
two distributions intersect. In other words, the model will respond :key['present'] whenever it is
more likely that the signal is indeed :key[present], and it will respond :key['absent'] whenever it
is more likely that the signal is indeed :key[absent]. This is not coincidental, and hints at the
strong link between SDT and decision making based on maximum likelihood and the likelihood ratio
:cite[@Creelman2015; @Peterson1954]. In fact, the early work on SDT usually expressed the bias as
<span class="math-var">Î²</span>, in terms of the likelihood ratio of signal and noise
:cite[@Peterson1954; @Tanner1954]. It was only later that :key[<span class="math-var">c</span>] was
introduced and suggested as a better measure of response bias for most purposes :cite[@Ingham1970;
@Macmillan1990; @Stanislaw1999].
