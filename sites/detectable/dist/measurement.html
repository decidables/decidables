Sensitivity: Towards a Theory of Performance</h1></header><section class="det-content"><h2>Measuring stimuli</h2><p>So far, we have focused on observing and summarizing human performance on a signal detection task. We are now going to shift our focus to understanding a <span class="term theory">theory</span> of how people perform signal detection tasks. As we go, we will develop a <span class="term model">model</span> that applies this theory to our particular random dot kinematogram task. (Much more could be said about the distinction, or lack thereof, between models and theories, but we will leave that for another day, or maybe another explorable explanation?).</p><p>According to SDT, the first step that must be performed in signal detection is to take a <span class="term measurement">measurement</span>. To continue our earlier examples, this might be a measurement of how much what we hear sounds like our friend's voice, or how much what we see looks like a distant boat on the sea, or how much what we smell has the aroma of a truffle. In human signal detection, this measurement is being carried out by the sensory and perceptual mechanisms of the participant's mind and brain. The result of this measurement is the <span class="term evidence">evidence</span> that a signal is present, represented as a single scalar value between negative infinity and infinity, with the <span class="term neutralpoint">neutral point</span>, where the evidence is equally suggestive of signal and noise, at the origin.</p><p>To help us visualize this measurement process, we can run trials of our RDK experiment, and instead of having you, dear reader, perform the measurement, we can construct a model that will simulate the measurement instead. When you <span class="ui Run">Run</span> the task below, on each trial, our model will take a measurement of the stimulus, and this will arrive on the graph as a box representing the <span class="key Evidence">Evidence</span>. The strength of the evidence is plotted along the horizontal x-axis. If another measurement is taken for which the evidence falls into the same <em>bin</em>, then that box will stack up on top of the one or ones already there. As a result, we end up with a histogram of the evidence values, with the count of occurrences on the vertical y-axis.</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="10" duration="1000"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="10" duration="1000" wait="1000" iti="1000"></rdk-task><sdt-model histogram color="none" d="0" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><h2>Presence or absence of signal</h2><p>In the example above, the evidence looks the same on every trial, except for its value. This emphasizes the fact that our model does not know whether each trial is a signal trial or a noise trial, or indeed anything else other than the value of the <span class="key Evidence">Evidence</span>!</p><p>However, we, as the experimenters, are privy to more information. We know whether each trial was a signal or noise trial. So we can color the measurement from each trial based on whether it was a <span class="key SignalPresent">Signal Present</span> or <span class="key SignalAbsent">Signal Absent</span> trial.</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="20" duration="750"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="20" duration="750" wait="750" iti="750"></rdk-task><sdt-model histogram color="stimulus" d="2" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><p>After we run the model for 20 trials, we can observe where the <span class="key SignalPresent">Signal Present</span> or <span class="key SignalAbsent">Signal Absent</span> measurements are falling on our evidence scale. Unless you were particularly unlucky, you can probably see that the signal trials are clustering on the upper end of the scale, while the noise trials are clustering toward the lower end of the scale...</p><h2>Distributions!</h2><p>This leads us to a key fact about the measurements our model is making. In SDT, the evidence on noise trials is drawn from one <span class="term distribution">distribution</span>, the <span class="key NoiseDistribution">Noise Distribution</span>, while on signal trials the evidence is drawn from a second distribution, the <span class="key Signal+NoiseDistribution">Signal + Noise Distribution</span>. The two distributions are both normal (Gaussian) with equal variance and with equal and opposite means around the neutral point. (We reconsider the equal variance assumption later on once we have worked through equal variance SDT).</p><p>Try running the example below. The evidence measured on each trial will appear on the graph, with the underlying distributions also shown. If we ran the simulation for enough trials, the histogram formed by the trial-by-trial data would match the underlying probability distributions. (Note that the y-axis scale for the probability distributions is on the left side of the graph, while the y-axis scale for the histogram is on the right.)</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="20" duration="500"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="20" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task><sdt-model distributions histogram color="stimulus" d="2" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><h2>Distributions near or far</h2><p>We can now get a sense of how the proximity of the two distributions determines how similar the observations on signal and noise trials are to each other. When the <span class="key NoiseDistribution">Noise Distribution</span> and the <span class="key Signal+NoiseDistribution">Signal + Noise Distribution</span> have similar means, we tend to make similar measurements of evidence on <span class="key SignalAbsent">Signal Absent</span> and <span class="key SignalPresent">Signal Present</span> trials:</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="20" duration="500"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="20" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task><sdt-model distributions histogram color="stimulus" d=".5" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><p>In other words, we are relatively insensitive to the differences between trial types. On the other hand, when the <span class="key NoiseDistribution">Noise Distribution</span> and the <span class="key Signal+NoiseDistribution">Signal + Noise Distribution</span> have very different means, we tend to make distinct measurements of evidence on <span class="key SignalAbsent">Signal Absent</span> and <span class="key SignalPresent">Signal Present</span> trials:</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="20" duration="500"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="20" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task><sdt-model distributions histogram color="stimulus" d="5" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><p>On these trials, we are much more sensitive to the different between signal and noise. (Note that evidence measurements that would be off the horizontal scale of the graph are stacked in the bin at the corresponding end of the scale.)</p><h2>Parameterizing distributions with sensitivity, <span class="math-var">d'</span></h2><p>The distance between the <span class="key NoiseDistribution">Noise Distribution</span> and the <span class="key Signal+NoiseDistribution">Signal + Noise Distribution</span> is the <span class="key Sensitivity">Sensitivity</span> or <span class="key d′">d′</span>. It lies along a continuum, from negative infinity to infinity. Zero indicates identical means, and no sensitivity. Positive numbers indicate stronger evidence measurements for signal trials than for noise trials. The larger the positive number, the more sensitive we are to the difference between signal and noise. On the other hand, negative numbers would indicate stronger evidence for noise trials than signal trials. Since we are talking about evidence of a <em>signal</em>, it would be unusual to have a measurement device that returns more evidence on noise trials than signal trials, but the theory allows for this possibility. Examples of situations where this could occur would be if the participant is confused about the task (i.e. they have signal and noise mixed up), or if the participant is actively responding incorrectly (i.e. they are intentionally misinterpreting evidence of a signal as evidence of noise).</p><p>In this example, the distance between the signal and noise distributions is explicitly labelled with <span class="key d′">d′</span>. You can drag either distribution left or right to change the distance between them. If there are evidence measurements for individual trials, they will move along with the distributions they were drawn from, allowing you to see how the <span class="key Sensitivity">Sensitivity</span> determines the degree of overlap between the <span class="key NoiseDistribution">Noise Distribution</span> and the <span class="key Signal+NoiseDistribution">Signal + Noise Distribution</span>:</p><sdt-example-model><detectable-control run pause reset trials="20" duration="500"></detectable-control><rdk-task count="100" coherence=".5" trials="20" duration="500" wait="500" iti="500"></rdk-task><sdt-model interactive distributions sensitivity histogram color="stimulus" d="1.5" c="0"></sdt-model></sdt-example-model><p>Perhaps you are wondering why <span class="key Sensitivity">Sensitivity</span> is represented with the symbol <span class="key d′">d′</span>. In the early work leading to SDT, for mathematical convenience, a parameter <span class="math-var">d</span> was used that was equal to the square of the difference between the means of the distributions (<a class="csl-ref" href="references.html#Peterson1954">Peterson et al., 1954</a>). This parameter was most likely named <span class="math-var">d</span> because it represented <span class="math-var">d</span>etectability. As SDT was developed, it became clear that the square root of <span class="math-var">d</span> was a more useful form, since it expressed <span class="math-var">d</span>etectability directly in the units of the probability distributions for signal and noise. Since "square root of <span class="math-var">d</span>" was a mouthful, it was replaced with the symbol <span class="key d′">d′</span>, pronounced 'dee-prime' (<a class="csl-ref" href="references.html#Creelman2015">Creelman, 2015</a>; <a class="csl-ref" href="references.html#Tanner1954">Tanner &#38; Swets, 1954</a>).</p></section><footer class="det-footer"><div class="det-footer-item det-footer-item-left"><a class="det-toc-link" href="roc.html"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-arrow-left-short" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M12 8a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H5.707l2.147 2.146a.5.5 0 0 1-.708.708l-3-3a.5.5 0 0 1 0-.708l3-3a.5.5 0 1 1 .708.708L5.707 7.5H11.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5z"/></svg> ROC Space</a></div><div class="det-footer-item det-footer-item-right"><a class="det-toc-link" href="threshold.html">Threshold &amp; Bias <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-arrow-right-short" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 8a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h5.793L8.146 5.354a.5.5 0 1 1 .708-.708l3 3a.5.5 0 0 1 0 .708l-3 3a.5.5 0 0 1-.708-.708L10.293 8.5H4.5A.5.5 0 0 1 4 8z"/></svg></a></div></footer></main></div></div><script type="module" src="page.js"></script></body></html>
