## Features/Bugs/Notes

- Allow use of keyboard in task!
- Random w/o replacement for better balancing of trial types?
- Labels on ROC curve?
- Resolve ambiguity between different uses of same color
  - For example, "Respond Present" as a trial type versus "Present" as a response versus
    "?Present?" as part of a distribution
- Switch to subsections for better overall organization/structure?
  - With auto linking of subsections?
- Add snazzy cover page?
- Add TOC page w/descriptions?
- Add page before SDT, connecting sensitivity and bias, and showing different views of model
  - Or build threshold on top of distributions, so they are naturally combined!
- Split Tables & Rates to discuss Accuracy & base rate
  - Change "Accuracy" in "outcomes.html"
  - Move "Tabulating outcomes" from "rates.html" to "outcomes.html"
  - Move "Accuracy" to top of "rates.html"
  - Add "PPV" and "FOMR" to rates.html"
  - Add page on "counter-intuitive" measures: accuracy & P(S|R) vs P(R|S)
- Asking lots of open-ended questions vs. questions with later answers vs. explanation...

## Development Tooling

### Local Scripts

- `yarn lint`
  - Lints markdown, scripts, and styles in `src/`
- `yarn compile`
  - Compiles/preprocesses files from `src/` to `local/` while pulling in dependencies
- `yarn watch`
  - Executes `compile` on file changes in `src/` or local package dependencies `../<library>/src/`
- `yarn build`
  - Builds optimized project from `local/` to `dist/`
- `yarn deploy`
  - Copies files from `dist/` to server
- `yarn serve`
  - Runs a basic http server, to serve `detectable/` (e.g. <http://localhost:8000/local/> or <http://localhost:8000/dist/>)

## Project File Organization

- `detectable/`
  - `dist/` (Optimized files for distribution, created from `local` by `build`)
    **\[autogenerated\]**
  - `local/` (Compiled project for local testing, created from `src` by `compile`)
    **\[autogenerated\]**
  - `src/` (Source files)
  - `gulpfile.js` (Config for *gulp*)
  - `package.json` (Config for *yarn*)
  - `README.md` (This file)
