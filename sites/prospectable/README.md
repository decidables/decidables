### Local Scripts

- `yarn lint`
  - Lints markdown, scripts, and styles in `src/`
- `yarn compile`
  - Compiles/preprocesses files from `src/` to `local/` while pulling in dependencies
- `yarn watch`
  - Executes `compile` on file changes in `src/` or local package dependencies `../<library>/src/`
- `yarn build`
  - Builds optimized project from `local/` to `dist/`
- `yarn deploy`
  - Copies files from `dist/` to server
- `yarn serve`
  - Runs a basic http server, to serve `prospectable/` (e.g. <http://localhost:8000/local/> or <http://localhost:8000/dist/>)

## Project File Organization

- `prospectable/`
  - `dist/` (Optimized files for distribution, created from `local` by `build`)
    **\[autogenerated\]**
  - `local/` (Compiled project for local testing, created from `src` by `compile`)
    **\[autogenerated\]**
  - `src/` (Source files)
  - `gulpfile.js` (Config for *gulp*)
  - `package.json` (Config for *yarn*)
  - `README.md` (This file)
