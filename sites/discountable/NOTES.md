## Outline

- *discountable*: Temporal discounting
  - Introduction
  - Behavior
    - Task: inter-temporal choice task
      - now vs later? immediate vs delayed? sooner vs later?
      - set: ds = 0, as = ?
      - variable: dl, al, as?
    - Method: stairstep procedure
    - Analysis: area under the curve (AUC)
  - Model (hyperbolic discounting)
    - Prescriptive: exponential
    - Empirical: violations - preference reversals
    - Descriptive: hyperbolic
    - Model comparison: none, linear, exponential, hyperbolic
    - Model exploration
    - Model fitting
    - Model prediction
  - Advanced
    - Interaction of temporal discounting and PT value function?
  - Applications
    - Drug addiction?
  - Conclusion
