## Development Tooling

### Local Scripts

- `yarn lint`
  - Lints markdown, scripts, and styles in `src/`
- `yarn compile`
  - Compiles/preprocesses files from `src/` to `local/` while pulling in dependencies
- `yarn watch`
  - Executes `compile` on file changes in `src/` or local package dependencies `../<library>/src/`
- `yarn build`
  - Builds optimized project from `local/` to `dist/`
- `yarn deploy`
  - Copies files from `dist/` to top level server directory `decidables.github.io`
- `yarn serve`
  - Runs a basic http server, to serve `decidables/` (e.g. <http://localhost:8000/local/> or
    <http://localhost:8000/dist/>)
