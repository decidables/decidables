In both, a weight of evidence is computed and accumulated to support or oppose the alternative interpretations. A decision is reached when the evidence reaches a threshold value. In the codebreaking scheme, the threshold determined the speed and accuracy of the decision process. Here we propose that in the brain, the threshold may be controlled by neural circuits that calculate the rate of reward.},

	abstract = {This book provides a grounded introduction to the fundamental concepts of mathematics, neuroscience and their combined use, thus providing the reader with a springboard to cutting-edge research topics and fostering a tighter integration of mathematics and neuroscience for future generations of students. The book alternates between mathematical chapters, introducing important concepts and numerical methods, and neurobiological chapters, applying these concepts and methods to specific topics. It covers topics ranging from classical cellular biophysics and proceeding up to systems level neuroscience. Starting at an introductory mathematical level, presuming no more than calculus through elementary differential equations, the level will build up as increasingly complex techniques are introduced and combined with earlier ones. Each chapter includes a comprehensive series of exercises with solutions, taken from the set developed by the authors in their course lectures. MATLAB code is included for each computational figure, to allow the reader to reproduce them. Biographical notes referring the reader to more specialized literature and additional mathematical material that may be needed either to deepen the reader's understanding or to introduce basic concepts for less mathematically inclined readers completes each chapter. - Introduces the reader to mathematical concepts of importance for the analysis of data and the formulation of theories in neuroscience, enabling all neuroscientists to apply and use those concepts in their research. - Includes, for example, linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier transforms, probabilities and stochastic processes, applying them to specific frequently encountered problems in neuroscience. For example, the book makes it possible for the researcher to apply linear algebra and differential equations to solve the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, probabilities to describe stochastic release, stochastic processes to describe noise in neurons, Fourier transforms to describe the receptive fields of visual neurons. - Introduces the numerical methods used to implement algorithms related to these mathematical concepts, including the tools necessary to solve systems of differential equations, issues of numerical stability, discrete Fourier transforms, discrete convolutions, computation of power spectra, crosscorrelations, the generation of sample stochastic processes and random variables. Need Feature Benefit An easy to follow introduction to the mathematical tools most commonly used in Neuroscience Integrates mathematical analysis and modeling tools systematically by using them to address specific well known problems in Neuroscience Saves significant time in understanding and adapting mathematical methods to common problems A book that provides a reference of tools to implement mathematical concepts on own problems A toolbox of Matlab code modules solving the most common mathematical problems encountered in the Neuroscience laboratory Modules can be directly adapted for use in the laboratory to save development time and cost A toolset for the systems neuroscientist to support thinking about their results in a broader theoretical framework By providing a systematic introduction of the most commonly used tools needed to create cellular models of brain function, this book opens up the possibility of theoretical modeling of results to the mathematically less inclined neuroscientist Opens a new horizon for systems neuroscientists for more sophisticated analysis and modeling of their results. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Can we study individual differences in sensitivity and response bias, using indices like the d' and β of signal detectability theory? To do this, it would be desirable to be able to estimate them independently and consistently. Sensitivity, measured by d', is not influenced by variations in β provided the variance of the noise distribution is equal to that of the signal-plus-noise distribution, but no such deduction can be made for β. The intra-individual variances can be assumed to be approximately equal in the investigation described, and d' may therefore be estimated without contamination by β. It cannot be assumed, however, that β remains stable for different levels of d'; in fact it can be shown to depend upon the decision strategy adopted by the subject. The consistency and orthogonality of indices of sensitivity and bias have been examined in an auditory detection task. Reasonably consistent estimates of d' were obtained from as few as forty responses. The bias index β was less satisfactory but another index related to it was more promising. The latter was orthogonal to d', under certain conditions, in the two-dimensional space describing inter-individual variation in detection behaviour. © 1970.},

	abstract = {Motion coherence thresholds in random-dot patterns have been widely adopted as a measure of performance in visual motion processing. However, there has been diversity in the type of “noise” in which a coherent motion signal has to be detected. Here we compare coherence thresholds for three ways of creating motion noise: dots replotted in random positions in each new frame; dots with a set displacement but following a random walk from frame to frame; or dots moving in random directions which remain constant for a given dot over a sequence of displacements. In each case, the signal dots may either remain the same throughout the display sequence, or the signal dots may be re-selected afresh on each frame (“different”). With our display (3 deg square, 120 msec exposure, velocity = 5 or 10 deg sec−1), all these different noise conditions yielded similar thresholds around 5–8\%. There were some small but systematic differences between conditions. Thresholds in random-direction displays were consistently higher than those in random-walk or random-position displays, especially at the lower velocity. However, this effect is much smaller than would be expected from the increased standard error of the noise mean in random direction, perhaps because the motion system integrates information most effectively over a local region of space and/or time. Subjects” performance could not be explained by a strategy of identifying individual signal dots with extended trajectories. The similarity between random-walk and random-position thresholds implies that subjects do not exploit the marked differences in speed distribution between signal and noise dots in the latter case. The practical message for the design and interpretation of experiments using coherence thresholds is that the results are not much affected by the choice of noise, at least within the range of stimuli tested here.

In the memory field, the view that there are independent implicit and explicit memory systems has been predominantly supported by dissociation evidence. Here, we argue that many of these dissociations do not necessarily imply distinct memory systems. We review recent work with a single-system computational model that extends signal-detection theory (SDT) to implicit memory. SDT has had a major influence on research in a variety of domains. The current work shows that it can be broadened even further in its range of application. Indeed, the single-system model that we present does surprisingly well in accounting for some key dissociations that have been taken as evidence for independent implicit and explicit memory systems.},

	abstract = {Random dot motion (RDM) displays have emerged as one of the standard stimulus types employed in psychophysical and physiological studies of motion processing. RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difficult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We find that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion direction processing.},

	abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},
