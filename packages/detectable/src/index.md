## Introduction

Welcome to **<span class='math-var'>d&prime;</span>ete<span class='math-var'>c</span>table**, an
interactive introduction to Signal Detection Theory (SDT). This site uses manipulable diagrams,
tables, and equations to explain the motivation, conceptualization, and application of SDT.

SDT can be viewed as an early and classic example of computational cognitive neuroscience - the
interdisciplinary study of mind, brain, and behavior through the melding of computational,
psychological, and neuroscientific approaches.

SDT was originally developed to understand the decisions of radar operators attempting to detect the
faint traces of enemy aircraft, bogeys, among the spurious flashes on the radar screen
[@Marcum1947; @Tanner1954; @Peterson1954].

- SDT as entry point into computational cognitive neuroscience
- SDT as an example of the decomposition of cognition
  - Processes of perception, decision making, etc...
- SDT as an example of applied cognitive science
  - History of SDT and radar
  - Other applications: memory, medicine, etc...
- SDT as an example of how we use formal models
  - Existence proofs of what is possible for a given conceptual framework/theory
  - A way to fit human data and test how well a theory can account for that data
  - A way to make quantitative predictions from theory for comparison to human data
- SDT as an example of the links between mind & brain & behavior
  - evidence accumulation and the neural basis of perceptual decision making

This site focuses on the core principles of SDT, so that you can then go off and explore these
various avenues of inquiry with a better foundational understanding of SDT.
