## Introduction

Welcome.

- SDT as entry point into computational cognitive neuroscience
- SDT as an example of the decomposition of cognition
  - Processes of perception, decision making, etc...
- SDT as an example of applied cognitive science
  - History of SDT and radar
  - Other applications: memory, medicine, etc...
- SDT as an example of how we use formal models
  - Existence proofs of what is possible for a given conceptual framework/theory
  - A way to fit human data and test how well a theory can account for that data
  - A way to make quantitative predictions from theory for comparison to human data
- SDT as an example of the links between mind & brain & behavior
  - evidence accumulation and the neural basis of perceptual decision making

This site focuses on the core principles of SDT, so that you can then go off and
explore these various avenues of inquiry with a better foundational
understanding of SDT.
